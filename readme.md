# iTunes Top Five

Uses the iTunes RSS API to get the current top five albums in a few different genres.

Based on my prototype on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/sheelah/full/zqaGBv/).

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:3000> in your browser.
