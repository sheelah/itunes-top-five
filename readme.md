# iTunes Top Five

Uses the iTunes RSS API to get the current top five albums in a few different genres.

Based on my prototype on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/sheelah/full/zqaGBv/).

Uses ReactJS and Redux for state management.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:3000> in your browser.

## Tooling

Install the [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) to view and debug state changes as
they occur. The app has been configured to work with this tool.
